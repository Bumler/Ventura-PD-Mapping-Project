# Ventura-PD-Mapping-Project
Hours of monotonous excel formatting were needed at the Ventura County Crime Analysis to properly prepare over 30,000 lines of data for mapping. We have created an executable program to combat the hours needed to perform this task. The Ventura County Data Automator is able to do these tasks in seconds and easily display the newly prepared data for the user, additionally it copies the new data onto the users clipboard automatically so that they can easily paste the formatted data into excel. This project currently has four features: Address Cleaner, City Inserter, Community Code Finder and APPS Formatter (which actually makes direct modifications to excel files). It also has a functioning GUI and breif user tutorial/write up. Starting April 6th the program should be in use at the department.
